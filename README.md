# Minio Training Labs Bash

This repo deploys custom Minio Labs using bash scripts.

This is in **ALPHA** and major changes will be made before it is ready for general consumption.

## Requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04 Server(s)
- 4vCPU / 8GB RAM Minimum Per Server
- 50-100GB of storage (depends on lab)
- SSH Access to Ubuntu Servers

## IMPORTANT NOTICE
You may incur some cost as a result of deploying this to your provisioned Ubuntu instance(s). Minio is not responsible for those costs.

Deployments are provided "AS-IS" with no guarantee on availability or complete functionality. These will be tested regularly, but ultimately you are responsible for deploying / maintaining / tearing down these systems.
